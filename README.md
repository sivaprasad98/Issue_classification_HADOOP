# Issue_classification_HADOOP
Using Neural Networks to assign a type (such as bug, improvement, sub-task) to an issue. 
Dataset creation using issues from HADOOP projects. The dataset shall include 
the fields which (you identify) are important for the purpose. The dataset for training 
and testing will be saved in CSV files.
2) Creation of a neural network using LSTM RNN to train a model for 
classifying an issue into a type.
3) Evaluation of the model using suitable metrics.
